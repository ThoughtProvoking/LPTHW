The Jupiter trojans, commonly called Trojan asteroids or just Trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the orbit of the planet Jupiter around the Sun.
Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates around one of Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points, L4, lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and L5, 60° behind.
Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5.2 AU.
